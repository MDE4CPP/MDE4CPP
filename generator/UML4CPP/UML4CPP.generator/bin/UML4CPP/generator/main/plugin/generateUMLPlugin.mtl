 * module to trigger model plugin generation
 * 
 * The plugin class is used to register the model library in the plugin framework und thus makes the model available for other models on C++ layer without direct linking during compilation.
 * The plugin class is realized as singleton. 
 * 
 * The plugin implements the interface UMLModelPlugin from pluginFramework project and provides the following functionality:
 * - model meta data (name, ns_uri, ns_prefix, eclipse specific uri)
 * - getter for model factory and model package
 *

 * - interface source file
 * - implementation header file
