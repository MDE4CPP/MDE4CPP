# General Guidelines

## Branch setup
- ``master`` : Release branch, release code only! Merged from the ``integration`` branch.
- ``integration`` : Integration stage branch, the stable code from branch ``development``.
- ``development`` : Development staging branch, almost all work is done here. Mature and tested features are merged into ``integration`` branch.

# Coding Style

Nothing special here at the moment. If you edit existing code please follow its coding style.
