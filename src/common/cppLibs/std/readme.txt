This is just an example for alias model to import C++ standard library datatypes (std::map, std::list, std::vector,...) into ecore models to use these datatypes as attribute or parameter datatype. 
Move or link this (dummy) model into a user model folder. Load (Load Ressorce) the model and use the datatype in the user model. 
Do not generate this (dummy) model.
